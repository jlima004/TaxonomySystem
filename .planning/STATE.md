# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-12)

**Core value:** Produzir um sistema semântico olfativo normalizado e computacionalmente útil — a Layer 1 (taxonomia pura) que serve de fundação para todas as camadas superiores de inteligência de fragrâncias.
**Current focus:** Phase 10 in progress — Round 3 workbook approvals, seed/alias curation, and relation/accord inputs are complete; v2 remains candidate-only, defaults remain v1, and final validation remains.

## Phase State

**Current Phase**: 10
**Phase Name**: Taxonomy Seed v2 Expansion Round 3
**Phase Slug**: 10-taxonomy-seed-v2-expansion-round-3
**Phase Status**: in_progress
**Execution Readiness**: ready_for_10-04
**Plans Created**: 4
**Plans Completed**: 3
**Artifacts**: Phase 10 planning artifacts plus completed 10-01/10-02/10-03 summaries, approved Round 3 seed additions in `taxonomy-seed.v2.json`, targeted `musky -> musk` alias cleanup, approved v2 relation/accord inputs, and curation tests.
**Next Recommended Work**: Execute 10-04 final validation comparing v1 baseline and v2 Round 3 candidate while preserving v1/default inputs.
**Candidate Policy**: Do not treat corpus candidates as curated descriptors
**Known Limitation**: v2 seed remains candidate-only; final Round 3 validation is not complete until 10-04.

## Decisions

- Phase 5 semantic noise is an explicit versioned data input passed through pure-function options.
- Phase 5 corpus-derived descriptors and clusters stay reviewable candidates and never mutate curated seed truth.
- Curated tradition and accord data remain explicit function inputs and versioned JSON files; calculators do not import data constants.
- Missing accord/tradition entries return undefined/neutral, not 0, preserving downstream renormalization semantics.
- Alias candidates are emitted only as weak evidence with canonical ids unchanged.
- Final scoring renormalizes over dimensions whose score is present; missing tradition or accord remains neutral rather than zero.
- Sparse graph eligibility is a strict final_score > 0.25 helper outside individual dimension calculators.
- Phase 5 graph edge contracts preserve score as a compatibility alias for final_score.
- Sparse similarity graph generation stores review_queue inside SimilarityGraph and uses deterministic generated_at defaults.
- Compile pipeline remains pure until CLI resolves generatedAt and writer performs filesystem output.
- Default CLI data paths keep documented parser defaults but resolve to ../data when run from the src package.
- Post-Phase 6 semantic findings do not invalidate v1 technical completion: `data/compiled/v1/` artifacts are deterministic, schema-valid and CLI-compilable.
- Phase 7 plan 07-03 added conservative placement scoring gates and deterministic merged review queue population in similarity output.
- compileTaxonomy now returns taxonomy plus placement_review_queue for deterministic downstream merge.
- Seed expansion in Phase 7 remains review-only via seed_taxonomy_gap_suggestion items and does not mutate seed hierarchy.
- Corpus-derived descriptors remain review-required candidates until descriptor sanitation, stronger placement scoring and curated review inputs are addressed.
- Curated aliases should be treated as future pre-analysis canonicalization inputs, not only final compiled alias outputs.
- Empty curated relation/accord inputs can validly produce an empty similarity graph, but future curation should bootstrap positive inputs and review warnings.
- Phase 7 must preserve seed taxonomy as curated truth, keep corpus candidates review-required, keep alias candidates as weak evidence only, preserve deterministic artifacts, add no runtime dependencies, and keep TypeScript strict/pure-function patterns.
- Canonicalization accepts curated alias seed/map only and remains isolated from alias candidates.
- Alias-candidate generation receives aliasSeed exclusion input but remains weak evidence only.
- Curated relation and accord v1 files are manually bootstrapped with locked records; no heuristic generation is allowed.
- compileAll now merges schema validation with runtime semantic quality gates before writeCompileResults can persist artifacts.
- compile:quality remains console-only and does not create sidecar artifact files.
- Similarity graph matching now uses simple `subfamily_id` values for curated relation and accord inputs, fixing the empty graph caused by `family:subfamily` internal IDs.
- Graph-empty curated-input failures are visible as high-severity `graph_empty_with_curated_inputs` review items when they occur.
- Phase 8 is a separate manual curation phase from Phase 7 pipeline hardening.
- Phase 8 starts in context gathering only; no executable plan, implementation, code change or compiled artifact change is authorized by registration.
- Phase 8 must preserve seed authority, review-only corpus evidence and zero auto-promotion.
- Phase 8 context captured CUR-D-01 through CUR-D-75; planning/research may proceed, but execution remains unauthorized until a plan exists and is approved.
- Seed v2 includes only persisted approved approval-001 gourmand/vanilla/vanilla.
- CLI/compiler defaults remain pointed at data/taxonomy/taxonomy-seed.v1.json; v2 remains explicit-path only.
- No aliases were added in 08-03 because candidate-review.md contains no approved primary_disposition: add_alias block.
- descriptor_aliases.seed.json was preserved unchanged in 08-03; pending aliases, secondary hypotheses, frequency evidence, and review_queue evidence were not promoted.
- V2 relation and accord companion inputs retain applicable manual v1 bootstrap records; no relation/accord score was added for `vanilla` without explicit curatorial approval.
- Missing relation/accord coverage for the new v2 `vanilla` subfamily is documented as gap rationale and remains neutral/undefined, not score 0.
- Alias target mismatches against minimal `taxonomy-seed.v2.json` are a soft 08-05 alias-quality finding only; do not alter legacy aliases or v2 descriptors without curatorial approval.
- Phase 09 Plan 03 applied only approved Round 2 relation/accord records with existing seed v2 endpoints; fresh_spice links remain pending because fresh_spice is absent.
- Phase 09 Plan 04 validated v2-expanded side-by-side against v1 using 10 metrics, found zero hard failures, and confirmed v2 remains candidate-only with CLI defaults and protected v1 artifacts unchanged.
- fresh_spice remains deferred because no approved seed endpoint exists, while vanilla is partially resolved through warm_spice relation/accord coverage.
- Phase 10 started in context gathering only; planning is now complete, but no implementation, code change, seed/data change or compiled artifact change is authorized before approval and final preflight.
- Phase 10 uses Phase 9 as baseline: v2-expanded has 7 families, 13 subfamilies, 32 seed descriptors, review_queue 331, relation_count 11 and accord_count 10.
- Phase 10 must not promote v2 to default, edit `taxonomy-seed.v1.json`, overwrite `data/compiled/v1/`, promote corpus/review_queue automatically, alter `DEFAULT_PATHS`, or alter aliases/relations/accords without workbook approval/rationale/evidence.
- Phase 10 context captured R3-D-01 through R3-D-52; planning/research completed with verified plans, and execution remains unauthorized until plans/workbook approvals and final preflight are approved.
- Phase 10 planning created exactly four executable future plans (10-01 through 10-04), but execution remains not_ready_for_execution until the 10-01 workbook checkpoint, no `Approval: pending` release condition, and final preflight pass.
- Phase 10 Plan 02 applied only complete approved Round 3 seed approvals and kept pending/generic/deferred candidates absent.
- Phase 10 Plan 02 added only approved r3-alias-cleanup-001 musky -> musk because canonical musk exists in candidate v2.
- [Phase 10]: Phase 10 Plan 03 applied only complete approved Round 3 relation records with existing v2 endpoints; all pending relation proposals remain absent.
- [Phase 10]: Phase 10 Plan 03 applied only complete approved Round 3 accord records with existing v2 endpoints; all pending accord proposals remain absent.
- [Phase 10]: No Round 3 relation_gap or accord_gap entries were needed because amber, balsamic_resin, musky, leathery, and fresh_spice all have approved relation and accord coverage.
