# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-12)

**Core value:** Produzir um sistema semântico olfativo normalizado e computacionalmente útil — a Layer 1 (taxonomia pura) que serve de fundação para todas as camadas superiores de inteligência de fragrâncias.
**Current focus:** Phase 8 complete — all 5 plans verified. v2 exists as candidate seed only.

## Phase State

**Current Phase**: 8
**Phase Status**: complete / verified
**Plans Created**: 5
**Plans Completed**: 5
**Artifacts**: `data/taxonomy/taxonomy-seed.v2.json` created as candidate seed (not default) from persisted approved workbook entry approval-001. v2 compiles via explicit `--seed` path only; defaults remain v1. All 25 curation tests pass. Hard failures: none. Soft warnings: 3 documented (alias quality, graph coverage, sparse expansion). `data/compiled/v1/` preserved unchanged.
**Next Recommended Work**: Phase 8 complete. Future curation waves may expand v2 coverage.
**Candidate Policy**: Do not treat corpus candidates as curated descriptors
**Known Limitation**: Curated inputs are intentionally minimal; `similarity_matrix.json` should be non-empty but sparse until future curation waves expand coverage.
**Last Activity**: 2026-05-23

## Decisions

- Phase 5 semantic noise is an explicit versioned data input passed through pure-function options.
- Phase 5 corpus-derived descriptors and clusters stay reviewable candidates and never mutate curated seed truth.
- Curated tradition and accord data remain explicit function inputs and versioned JSON files; calculators do not import data constants.
- Missing accord/tradition entries return undefined/neutral, not 0, preserving downstream renormalization semantics.
- Alias candidates are emitted only as weak evidence with canonical ids unchanged.
- Final scoring renormalizes over dimensions whose score is present; missing tradition or accord remains neutral rather than zero.
- Sparse graph eligibility is a strict final_score > 0.25 helper outside individual dimension calculators.
- Phase 5 graph edge contracts preserve score as a compatibility alias for final_score.
- Sparse similarity graph generation stores review_queue inside SimilarityGraph and uses deterministic generated_at defaults.
- Compile pipeline remains pure until CLI resolves generatedAt and writer performs filesystem output.
- Default CLI data paths keep documented parser defaults but resolve to ../data when run from the src package.
- Post-Phase 6 semantic findings do not invalidate v1 technical completion: `data/compiled/v1/` artifacts are deterministic, schema-valid and CLI-compilable.
- Phase 7 plan 07-03 added conservative placement scoring gates and deterministic merged review queue population in similarity output.
- compileTaxonomy now returns taxonomy plus placement_review_queue for deterministic downstream merge.
- Seed expansion in Phase 7 remains review-only via seed_taxonomy_gap_suggestion items and does not mutate seed hierarchy.
- Corpus-derived descriptors remain review-required candidates until descriptor sanitation, stronger placement scoring and curated review inputs are addressed.
- Curated aliases should be treated as future pre-analysis canonicalization inputs, not only final compiled alias outputs.
- Empty curated relation/accord inputs can validly produce an empty similarity graph, but future curation should bootstrap positive inputs and review warnings.
- Phase 7 must preserve seed taxonomy as curated truth, keep corpus candidates review-required, keep alias candidates as weak evidence only, preserve deterministic artifacts, add no runtime dependencies, and keep TypeScript strict/pure-function patterns.
- Canonicalization accepts curated alias seed/map only and remains isolated from alias candidates.
- Alias-candidate generation receives aliasSeed exclusion input but remains weak evidence only.
- Curated relation and accord v1 files are manually bootstrapped with locked records; no heuristic generation is allowed.
- compileAll now merges schema validation with runtime semantic quality gates before writeCompileResults can persist artifacts.
- compile:quality remains console-only and does not create sidecar artifact files.
- Similarity graph matching now uses simple `subfamily_id` values for curated relation and accord inputs, fixing the empty graph caused by `family:subfamily` internal IDs.
- Graph-empty curated-input failures are visible as high-severity `graph_empty_with_curated_inputs` review items when they occur.
- Phase 8 is a separate manual curation phase from Phase 7 pipeline hardening.
- Phase 8 starts in context gathering only; no executable plan, implementation, code change or compiled artifact change is authorized by registration.
- Phase 8 must preserve seed authority, review-only corpus evidence and zero auto-promotion.
- Phase 8 context captured CUR-D-01 through CUR-D-75; planning/research may proceed, but execution remains unauthorized until a plan exists and is approved.
- Seed v2 includes only persisted approved approval-001 gourmand/vanilla/vanilla.
- CLI/compiler defaults remain pointed at data/taxonomy/taxonomy-seed.v1.json; v2 remains explicit-path only.
- No aliases were added in 08-03 because candidate-review.md contains no approved primary_disposition: add_alias block.
- descriptor_aliases.seed.json was preserved unchanged in 08-03; pending aliases, secondary hypotheses, frequency evidence, and review_queue evidence were not promoted.
- V2 relation and accord companion inputs retain applicable manual v1 bootstrap records; no relation/accord score was added for `vanilla` without explicit curatorial approval.
- Missing relation/accord coverage for the new v2 `vanilla` subfamily is documented as gap rationale and remains neutral/undefined, not score 0.
- Alias target mismatches against minimal `taxonomy-seed.v2.json` are a soft 08-05 alias-quality finding only; do not alter legacy aliases or v2 descriptors without curatorial approval.

## Last Session

- **Stopped At**: Phase 8 complete / verified

## Active Phase

None. Phase 8 complete. No active execution.

## Workstreams

- Phase 8 complete. v2 is a candidate seed usable via explicit `--seed` path only. All defaults remain v1. No data artifacts were modified. No auto-promotion occurred.
